								<p>I’m Saifeddine EL MADANI. I’m in my last year of engineering at the Institut Mines Telecom of Lille and I'm looking for my end-of-studies internship as a data scientist consultant in finance for a period of 6 months from the 01/12/2020</p>
								<p>The studies as well as the professional experiences that I was able to carry out as part of my school career have enabled me to adopt a versatile profile and therefore relevant for the position of data scientist.</p>
								<p>My internship at the Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français (SNCF) as an assistant to the project manager alongside the IT System Department, for example introduced me to the concept of client and the importance of the fluidity of communication between the different parts of the project.</p>
								<p>Through the missions that were offered to me, I was able to gain confidence and therefore independently lead meetings between clients and developers, but also develop solutions to facilitate the communication between the two. This experience also helped me cultivate a sense of organization, flexibility and team spirit.</p>
								<p>On the other hand, the missions that I was able to carry out during my last internship in Helsinki in Finland within the start-up CosmEthics, allowed me to put into practice the theoretical courses in data science through a project of logo recognition with Python and SQL queries for some internal data analysis. Finally, this internship as a Social media strategist also allowed me to develop my sense of design, an equally important quality for a data scientist so that he best communicates the relevance of the data processed.</p>
